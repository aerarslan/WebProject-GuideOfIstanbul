            <h1>How to Plan a Holiday in Istanbul?</h1>

        <div class="lowerContent-main">
            <p> Properly planning a trip to Istanbul can really make or break your holiday. I can’t count the amount of times people wrote to me things like: “I didn’t know Sabiha Gökçen Airport was on tbe Asian side of Istanbul!”, or “I didn’t know that the area where our hotel is located doesn’t have proper night life!”. So before your trip, don't forget to read about where you stay, how to go somewhere, transportation etc..

            <p>Istanbul is a dream destination, it´s located in the edge of Europe where east meets west. Connecting the two continents, the city hides layers of history, culture, colors and scents. The architecture, the food, everything in Istanbul tells a story. The city is busy, fast, never stops, but when you need a break from all this fervid life there is always a nice garden, a small tea house or a mosque where you can seat, breath and relax.</p>
            <p>Many people have the idea that Turkey is not a friendly country due to the Muslim religion and culture. But the truth is: when you leave the prejudice behind you will be enchanted by the beauty of Turkey and its people. As much as you discover the city more you fell in love of Istanbul.</p>
            <img  src="../img/planning/firstpage2.jpg"  />
            <p>For your first trip to Istanbul I would recommend at least five days, so you can have the taste of the ancient city and also enjoy the modern side of Istanbul. Although if you want to explore the big cities and the countryside, I´d say you should book a 10 days holiday minimum. In our last trip to Turkey we spent 60 days around the country and we didn’t have time to enjoy everything.
            </p><p>
            Istanbul is huge, in 2013 there were 14 million people living there. The city is as big as any other European capital, however Turkey is a cheap destination if you compare with other countries. With a good travel planning I´m sure you’ll enjoy your first trip to Istanbul without emptying your pocket. Sounds good, isn’t it?
