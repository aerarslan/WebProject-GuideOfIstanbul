        <div class="lowerContent-main">
            <p> Is the Museum Pass Istanbul something I should apply for? I get this question a lot from people planning to visit the Turkish metropolitan. Unfortunately, there is no straightforward answer to this question.
            <img  src="../img/sightseeing/Istanbul-Museum-Pass.jpg"  />
            </p>
            <p> It all depends on what you plan to visit and/or whether you mind standing (for a long time) in a queue or not. So let me explain what the Istanbul Museum Pass is, what you can (not) do with it, whether it’s right for you, and how you can get one.
            </p>
            <h2>What Is the Istanbul Museum Pass?</h2>
            <p>
            The Museum Pass is a one-time payment card that provides you access to historical museums and cultural points of interest in Istanbul. There are two types (see below). Both are valid for a certain amount of days, starting from the moment you first use it (not the moment you bought it).
            </p>
            <h2>Is the MüzeKart the same as the Museum Pass?</h2>
            <p>
            No. The Turkish Culture and Tourism Ministry introduced the MüzeKart in 2008. It was, and still is, a huge success among Turkish citizens. It also drew the attention of tourists, but they were not allowed to buy one. This outcry resulted in the creation of a separate card, the Museum Pass Istanbul.
            </p>
            <p>
            The MüzeKart is valid for 300+ museums nationwide. Only Turkish nationals and foreigners with a residence permit can obtain it.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Museum Pass Istanbul is for tourists visiting the metropolitan, hence providing access to a limited amount of venues.
            </p>
            <p>
            So, as a tourist to Istanbul, the Museum Pass is the one and only card you can apply for!
            </p>
            <h2>What Sightseeing Spots Can You Visit with the Museum Pass?</h2>
            <p>
            The Museum Pass includes free access to the following areas of interest:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hagia Sophia</li>
                <li>Topkapi Palace and the Harem</li>
                <li>Hagia Irene</li>
                <li>Istanbul Archaeological Museums</li>
                <li>Istanbul Mosaic Museum</li>
                <li>Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts</li>
                <li>Museum of the History of Science and Technology in Islam
</li>
                <li>Chora Church or Mosaic Museum
</li>
                <li>Galata Mevlevi House Museum</li>
                <li>Yıldız Palace Museum</li>
                <li>Rumeli Hisar Museum</li>
                <li>Fethiye Museum</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What Are the Advantages of the Museum Pass?</h2>
            <p>
            The card, regardless whether you chose the three or five day one, also includes discounts ranging from 10 to 20% in various sightseeing spots as well as shops across Istanbul. The list is too long to include here, but let me highlight a few that may interest you:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maiden Tower</li>
                <li>Rahmi M. Koç Museum</li>
                <li>Sakip Sabanci Museum</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What Are the Advantages of the Museum Pass?</h2>
            <p>
            The most important advantage is the ease of use. You no longer need to stand in line to buy your tickets and/or queue to get in.
            </p>
            <p>
            Also, if you plan to visit all of the above mentioned places, you spend less money. If you don’t plan to visit all, you’ll probably spend more, but still have the ease of use.
            </p>
            <h2>How Much Does the Istanbul Museum Pass Cost?</h2>
            <p>
            TheIstanbul Museum Pass costs 125 TL per person. The card is valid for 5 days from the moment you first use the card. However, you can only visit each museum included in the museum pass once. Every card has the applicant’s name on it, and you may be asked to provide identification when entering.
            </p>
            <p>
            Children under the age of 12 years enter for free in the included venues, so no need to buy a card for them.
