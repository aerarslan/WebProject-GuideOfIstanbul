# Web Project about Istanbul - GuideOfIstanbul

While I was studying in Poland and travelling Europe, I realized that almost everyone I have met had no idea about Istanbul. So I wanted to prepare a guide about Istanbul. I also wanted to learn things and improve myself about web programming. 

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to show people the most important things about Istanbul. ( For example; where to visit, what to eat etc. ) Everyone who visits Istanbul can find very useful informations in my guide about their visits.

### Notice

This project is developed with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

## How Does The Project Look Like?
